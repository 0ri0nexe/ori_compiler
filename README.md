# Ori Compiler

This is a purely learning oriented project. Making a compiler to get a better understanding of what is appening under the hood. Seems to be a good way to learn some low level things.

## What is it ?

This is just a simple implementation of a C compiler for x86 and windows on 64-bit.

## Why not 32-bit ?

We can find more infos on 32-bit assembly but this is old and sometimes even deprecated.

## Structure

The structure is very common for compilers :
- a Lexer : [lexer.rs](/src/lexer/mod.rs)
- a Parser : [not implemented yet]()
- an Assembly Generator [not implemented yet]()
